		<p>People often wonder how the left and right brain come together. The simple answer is through design strategy. I use design to tell strategic stories that resonate with the right audience. The best way to solve business problems is to use the lens of design and iteration to find the right solution. </p>

				<h3>Design Within Reach VIA</h3>
				<p>Design Within Reach came in with the brief of expanding their current product offerings. We responded with providing a whole meaning to design within reach-through travel. Our proposal was to create a design oriented travel experience in cities that allowed potential customers to not only live into DWR furniture but their brand experience behind storytelling.

				<h3>NewAid</h3>
				<p>This project conducted extensive primary and secondary research at The New School University to determine how students spend their free time during midterms and final exams. We found that although students may know that they are mishandling their time, it is done intuitively. Through focus groups and other primary research we found that students respond best to adding ways to help them manage what little time they had rather than asking them to do change their habits.
				Created with Austin Hambling, Megan Jana and Laura Buitrago.</p>
